This is a minimal, but runnable Django app called 𝜇Django.

My goal was to create a runnable Django snippet that included a model.

I found several useful resources, but most no longer work under Django 1.7:

* a related discussion on [Stack Overflow][so]
* the Django wiki article on [dynamic models][wiki]
* [mini_django.py gist][gist] based on a [blog post][blog] about running Django
    in one file
* posts on Django in one file that just don't include models:
    [Olifante][olifante] and [software maniacs][maniacs]
